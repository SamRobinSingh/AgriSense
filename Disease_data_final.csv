DISEASE NAME,DESCRIPTION,SOLUTION
Tomato___Bacterial_spot,"Bacterial spot causes leaf, fruit, and stem lesions. It thrives in warm, wet conditions. Symptoms include small, dark spots with yellow halos. It can lead to defoliation and yield loss. Control includes copper sprays and resistant varieties.",Use copper-based bactericides and resistant varieties. Practice crop rotation and proper sanitation. Avoid overhead watering to reduce leaf wetness. Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Maintain proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
Tomato___Early_blight,"Early blight is caused by Alternaria solani. Symptoms are dark, concentric spots on lower leaves. It spreads in warm, humid weather. Management includes crop rotation, fungicides, and resistant varieties. Severe infections can defoliate plants.",Apply fungicides regularly and use resistant varieties. Practice crop rotation and remove infected plant debris. Ensure proper spacing for air circulation. Mulch to reduce soil splashing onto leaves. Avoid overhead watering and manage weeds.
Tomato___Late_blight,"Late blight is caused by Phytophthora infestans. Symptoms are water-soaked lesions on leaves and fruit. It thrives in cool, wet conditions. Control measures include fungicides and resistant varieties. It can cause significant crop loss.",Use fungicides and resistant varieties. Destroy infected plants immediately. Avoid overhead watering and provide good air circulation. Monitor weather conditions and apply treatments preventatively. Practice crop rotation and sanitation.
Tomato___Leaf_Mold,Leaf mold is caused by Passalora fulva. It appears as yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. The underside develops olive-green mold. It prefers high humidity and poor ventilation. Control includes fungicides and proper spacing.,Apply fungicides and ensure good air circulation. Avoid overhead watering and reduce humidity in the growing area. Use resistant varieties and practice crop rotation. Remove and destroy infected leaves. Space plants properly to enhance airflow.
Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot,"Septoria leaf spot is caused by Septoria lycopersici. Symptoms include small, circular spots with dark borders. It spreads in wet conditions. Management involves crop rotation, removing infected leaves, and fungicides. It reduces photosynthesis.",Apply fungicides and remove infected leaves. Practice crop rotation and avoid overhead watering. Ensure good air circulation and proper plant spacing. Mulch to reduce soil splashing onto leaves. Use resistant varieties and maintain garden sanitation.
Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite,"Spider mites are tiny pests that cause stippling on leaves. Severe infestations lead to bronzing and leaf drop. They thrive in hot, dry conditions. Control includes miticides and maintaining humidity. Natural predators can also help.",Apply miticides and maintain adequate humidity. Use insecticidal soaps or oils. Introduce natural predators like ladybugs and predatory mites. Avoid drought stress by regular watering. Regularly inspect plants and remove heavily infested leaves.
Tomato___Target_Spot,"Target spot is caused by Corynespora cassiicola. Symptoms are dark, concentric spots on leaves and fruit. It spreads in warm, wet conditions. Control includes fungicides and resistant varieties. It can cause significant yield loss.",Apply fungicides and use resistant varieties. Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation. Avoid overhead watering and practice crop rotation. Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Maintain garden sanitation and monitor for symptoms.
Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus,Tomato yellow leaf curl virus is transmitted by whiteflies. Symptoms include yellowing and curling of leaves. It stunts plant growth and reduces yield. Control involves managing whiteflies and using resistant varieties. There is no cure once infected.,Manage whitefly populations using insecticides and reflective mulches. Use resistant tomato varieties. Remove and destroy infected plants. Use row covers to prevent whitefly infestation. Practice good garden sanitation and crop rotation.
Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus,"Tomato mosaic virus causes mottled leaves and stunted growth. It spreads through infected tools, soil, and plant material. Symptoms include mosaic patterns on leaves. Control includes sanitation and resistant varieties. It affects overall plant health.",Use resistant varieties and practice crop rotation. Sanitize tools and hands after handling plants. Remove and destroy infected plants. Avoid smoking near plants to prevent tobacco mosaic virus transmission. Keep the garden free of weeds and debris.
Tomato___healthy,"Healthy tomato plants have vibrant green leaves and strong stems. They show no signs of disease or pests. Optimal growth occurs with proper watering, fertilization, and sunlight. Regular monitoring helps maintain plant health and high yield.",Maintain proper watering and fertilization practices. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overcrowding. Monitor for pests and diseases regularly. Use mulches to conserve moisture and control weeds. Practice crop rotation and garden sanitation.
